            <p>Sherlock has determined you've been spreading misinformation on the internet.</p>
            <p id="update-message">Ah, my dear friend, I see that you have been duped by the misinformation that is so prevalent on the internet these days.

Malaria is indeed a very real disease, and it is transmitted by mosquitoes. While it is true that the risk of contracting malaria in Mexico is low, it is not non-existent. In fact, the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa and Tabasco have all reported cases of malaria in recent years.

The risk of malaria is present intermittently throughout the year, and it is recommended that travellers to these areas take steps to avoid mosquito bites. This includes covering up with clothing such as long sleeves and long trousers, using insect repellents on exposed skin, and sleeping under a mosquito net if necessary.

It is also worth noting that while major resorts and the US-Mexico border region are free of malaria, there are some rural areas where the risk is present. These include some areas in the states of Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa.

So, my dear friend, while you may have been fortunate enough to avoid contracting malaria during your travels to Mexico, it is not a hoax. It is a very real disease that can have serious and sometimes fatal consequences.

I suggest that you take the time to educate yourself on the risks of malaria and other diseases before travelling to any new destination. It is always better to be safe than sorry, is it not?
