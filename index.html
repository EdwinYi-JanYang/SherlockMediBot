            <h1>You've been caught!</h1>
            <p>Sherlock has determined you've been spreading misinformation on the internet.</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/12/13/46/sherlock-holmes-147255_1280.png" alt="Sherlock Holmes" />
            <p id="update-message">Ah, my dear Watson, it seems we have another case of misinformation on our hands.<br> This time, the culprit is a misguided individual who claims that malaria is a hoax, simply because they have not contracted it during their five visits to Mexico.<br>

Allow me to enlighten this misguided soul with the facts.<br> Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes.<br> While it is true that the risk of malaria in Mexico is generally low, it is not non-existent.<br> In fact, in recent years, the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa and Tabasco have reported cases.<br>

The risk of malaria is not evenly distributed throughout Mexico.<br> Major resorts and the US-Mexico border region are free of the disease.<br> However, there are some rural areas, particularly in the states mentioned above, where malaria risk is present intermittently.<br>

It is important to note that malaria cannot be prevented by a vaccine.<br> Therefore, travellers to Mexico are advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as covering up with clothing, using insect repellents, and sleeping under a mosquito net.<br>

In conclusion, my dear Watson, this individual's claim that malaria is a hoax is nothing more than a dangerous fallacy.<br> It is imperative that travellers to Mexico, or any other country with a risk of malaria, take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from this potentially deadly disease.<br>

As for the accuracy of the original post, I would rate it a 0 out of 10.<br><br><br> Watson! It seems our culprit is a serial rabble rouser!
