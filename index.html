            <p>Sherlock has determined you've been spreading misinformation on the internet.</p>
            <p id="update-message">My dear Watson,

I have been informed that a certain individual has claimed that malaria is a hoax. This is a most preposterous assertion, and I shall endeavour to correct this misinformation with the utmost haste.

Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It is not a hoax, but a very real threat to human health. While it is true that the risk of malaria in Mexico is low, it is not non-existent. In recent years, the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa and Tabasco have reported cases.

The risk of malaria is present intermittently throughout the year in some rural areas not normally visited by tourists. These include some areas in the states of Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa. However, there is no risk of malaria in popular tourist destinations such as Acapulco, Mexico City, Cancun, Cozumel and the Mayan Riviera.

It is possible that this individual has not contracted malaria because they have taken appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites. The CDC recommends that travellers to Mexico take steps to prevent bug bites, such as covering exposed skin with long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats, using an appropriate insect repellent, and staying in air-conditioned or screened rooms.

Furthermore, the CDC recommends that travellers to certain areas of Mexico take prescription medicine to prevent malaria. This medicine should be taken multiple days before the trip, as well as during and after the trip. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate medication and dosage.

In conclusion, malaria is not a hoax, but a real and potentially deadly disease. While the risk of malaria in Mexico is low, it is important to take appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites and to consult with a healthcare provider about malaria medication.

I trust that this information will be of use to you, my dear Watson.

Yours faithfully,
Sherlock Holmes
