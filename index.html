            <h1>You've been caught!</h1>
            <p>Sherlock has determined you've been spreading misinformation on the internet.</p>
            <p id="update-message">Ah, my dear Watson, it seems we have another case of misinformation on our hands. This time, the culprit is a certain individual who claims that malaria is a hoax, having never caught it during their five visits to Mexico.

I must say, this is a rather bold statement, and one that requires a thorough investigation. You see, my dear friend, malaria is a very real and serious disease, transmitted by mosquitoes. It cannot be prevented by a vaccine, and the risk of infection is present in some parts of Mexico.

According to my sources, the risk of malaria in Mexico is low and is present intermittently throughout the year. In recent years, the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, and Tabasco have reported cases. However, major resorts and the US-Mexico border region are free of the disease.

Now, my dear Watson, let us consider the evidence. The fact that this individual has not contracted malaria during their travels to Mexico does not prove that the disease is a hoax. It is entirely possible that they have simply been fortunate enough to avoid exposure to the disease.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease. It is not something to be taken lightly, and travellers to Mexico are advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as covering up with clothing, using insect repellents, and sleeping under a mosquito net.

In conclusion, my dear friend, I must say that this individual's claim that malaria is a hoax is entirely unfounded. It is a dangerous and irresponsible statement that could lead to people neglecting the very real risks of this disease. I suggest that we take immediate action to correct this misinformation and ensure that travellers to Mexico are aware of the potential dangers of malaria.

As for the accuracy of the original post, I would rate it a 1 out of 10.
Watson! It seems our culprit is a serial rabble rouser! We've seen misinformation spread from this individual before!
