            <p>Sherlock has determined you've been spreading misinformation on the internet.</p>
            <p id="update-message">Ah, the case of the missing malarial infection.

I must say, my dear Watson, that this case is particularly intriguing. The user claims that malaria is a hoax, yet they have never caught it. But, as we know, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

The user has been to Mexico five times, and it is true that malaria is not a significant risk in the country. However, it is not a hoax. Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It cannot be vaccinated against, and while the risk in Mexico is low, it is present intermittently throughout the year. In recent years, the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa and Tabasco have reported cases.

The user's claim that they have never caught malaria is not evidence that it is a hoax. It is possible that they have not been exposed to the disease, or that they have been taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites. It is also possible that they have been infected with malaria but have not shown any symptoms. Malaria can develop even up to one year after exposure, so it is important to seek medical attention if you have been travelling in a malarious area and develop a fever.

In conclusion, the user's claim that malaria is a hoax is false. It is a real disease that can be fatal, and while the risk in Mexico is low, it is still present in some areas. It is important to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and to seek medical attention if you develop a fever after travelling in a malarious area.
