## Inspiration
One of our team members is from Mexico, where there is rampant misinformation online about certain diseases, medicines, and a lot of social media influencers who claim ridiculous health facts and give advice to people. We wanted to reduce the harm of misinformation through a fun threads bot.
## What it does
A threads user can reply to a thread and @ our bot account to have it look through the post, and respond with sources that either support or disagree with the content.
## How we built it
We used cohere's api and prompt engineered the chat bot to reply to posts and provide reliable sources from WHO, HHS, nutrition.gov, nih.gov, and more.
## Challenges we ran into
Threads has a 500 character limit, so we had to find a workaround to provide more information.
As a two person team without much front-end experience, we found it difficult to setup a nice looking frontend for the bot's replies to be hosted.
